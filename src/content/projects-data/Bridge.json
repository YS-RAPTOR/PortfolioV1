    "description": "In this personal university project, I undertook the exciting challenge of designing and crafting a truss bridge using popsicle sticks. The result was a visually captivating structure with a remarkable clear span of 600mm and a width of 100mm, demonstrating my commitment to meticulous design and hands-on craftsmanship.\n\nWhat truly makes this project stand out is its impressive performance. Surpassing the initial target of 50kg, the bridge demonstrated its strength by carrying a remarkable 60kg load. Remarkably, the bridge itself weighed only 0.397kg, a testament to my expertise in efficient material utilization and structural design.\n\nWhat made this project truly exceptional was its ability to defy expectations. While initially designed to support a load of 50kg, this popsicle truss bridge astoundingly withstood a load of 60kg during testing, showcasing its remarkable strength and resilience. This outstanding performance translated into an exceptional load-to-weight ratio of 151.\n\nThis project not only highlights my passion for engineering but also underscores my capability to blend creativity with scientific principles, resulting in reliable and efficient designs."
