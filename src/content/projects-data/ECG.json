    "description": "The ECG Analyzer software developed using Matlab is CLI tool designed to efficiently filter out noise in ECG signals and accurately label different artifacts such as the QRS complex, P wave, and T wave. The software can extract important data, including heart rate, PR interval, QT interval, and QRS duration using the labeled artifacts.\n\nThe software displays the extracted information and informs the user of the results obtained. Additionally, the software can comment on the normalcy of the results received, allowing the user to quickly and easily identify any abnormal findings.\n\nOverall, the software achieves its functionalities by utilizing advanced digital signal processing techniques, including filtering, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. This project demonstrates my familiarity with these concepts. Additionally, the software is equipped with a user-friendly interface, allowing for easy input of ECG data and interpretation of results. This project serves to showcase my proficiency with digital signal processing concepts and also highlights my ability to use MatLab to create a CLI tool. This project further highlights my analytical skills and research skills since I had no prior familiarity with Electrocardiograms(ECGs)."
