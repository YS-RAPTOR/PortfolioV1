description: "I created an API interface for the web version of Super Auto Pets, a popular strategy game developed by Team Wood Games. The interface was developed in python using several tools and technologies such as Selenium, OpenCV, Tesseract, Sockets, and Pillow.\n

Selenium was used to automate the web browser and simulate user interactions with the game. OpenCV and Tesseract were used for image processing and text recognition, respectively, to extract game information such as health, number of wins, gold and the round. Sockets were used to establish a communication channel between the web browser and the Python script that controlled the game. Pillow was used to manipulate images and store image data.\n

Sockets were used to create a Server-Client Architecture so that the API and the client using the API can run on different machines. TCP was the communication protocol used to communicate between the server and client. This feature enables developers to access game data and control the game remotely, providing greater flexibility and convenience. This functionality can be specially important for AI developers who would want to train the AI on a separate machine.\n

The API interface allows developers to perform any action within the game and get back information about the game. This enables them to create bots and AI for this game. The interface can also be used to automate gameplay and test different scenarios.\n

Overall, this project demonstrates my skills in web automation, computer vision, and API development. It highlights my ability to work with multiple tools and technologies to create complex systems that can handle diverse inputs and provide useful outputs. It also shows my creativity in applying these skills to a popular game."
