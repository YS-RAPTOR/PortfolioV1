description: "The traffic light system project was developed as part of my digital electronic design coursework, where I designed and coded a traffic light system using VHDL and Xilinx ISE for a CPLD. As the project leader, I worked closely with my team to create a functional system that met the project requirements.\n

The traffic light system works based on digital design concepts such as state machines, clocking, and signal timing. The system was designed to be reliable and accurate, ensuring the proper timing of traffic lights. Additionally, the project demonstrated my skills in digital design using VHDL and proficiency with Xilinx ISE.\n

Overall, this project showcased my ability to apply theoretical concepts to practical applications and to design functional systems. It demonstrated my proficiency in digital design and hardware engineering, and my ability to work with digital circuits and systems to meet project requirements effectively. Additionally, the project highlighted my problem-solving skills and my ability to troubleshoot and debug issues that arose during the project."
