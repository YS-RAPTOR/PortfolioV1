description: "
The BODMAS Calculator is a project that my team developed as an assignment for our Embedded Micro Controllers unit. The calculator works similarly to a scientific calculator and supports all the basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. In addition to these operations, it also supports brackets, square root, percentages, and negative numbers, making it a versatile tool for complex calculations.\n\n
To make the calculator user-friendly and intuitive, we added a cursor that allows users to edit the expression before evaluating it. The screen used was a 16x2 LCD display and the calculator could handle a maximum of 256 characters for a single expression.\n\n
To enhance the functionality of the calculator, we also included memory operations such as memory recall, memory addition, and memory subtraction. The calculator also checks for syntax errors and displays error messages on the LCD screen if an invalid input or expression is detected.\n\n
Overall, the BODMAS Calculator project showcases our team's skills in embedded systems design, programming, and user interface design. It demonstrates our ability to develop complex systems that can handle a variety of inputs and operations while maintaining reliability and accuracy. It also highlights our familiarity with essential tools such as LCD displays, microcontrollers, and programming languages such as C++."
