description: "My portfolio website is a static website with a very interactive background running the Game of Life. It was built using the Astro framework as the static site generator, TailwindCSS, React, Framer Motion, Three.js and GLSL/OpenGL.\n

The Astro framework provided a solid foundation for creating a clean and modern website structure, while React allowed for the easy creation of reusable components. TailwindCSS was used to style the website. This allowed for the creation of a consistent and responsive design system with minimal custom CSS. Framer Motion was used to add smooth and fluid animations throughout the website, providing a seamless user experience. The use of Three.js and OpenGL for the game of life simulation created an interactive and visually engaging background element on the site.\n

Overall, my portfolio website demonstrates my skills in web development, design, animation, and creative coding. It showcases my ability to create visually engaging and interactive websites using a variety of tools and technologies."
