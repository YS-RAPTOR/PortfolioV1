In this university project, I undertook the challenge of designing and constructing a DIY bridge with the highest weight-to-load ratio. The objective was clear: create a bridge with a minimum span of 600mm, a weight under 1kg, a width exceeding 80mm, and the ability to sustain a load for at least 10 seconds. The project's success hinged on achieving an exceptional weight-to-load ratio, which would be a key factor in earning top marks.

To embark on this ambitious endeavor, I turned to Blender, a powerful 3D modeling and visualization tool. Blender allowed me to explore various design concepts and visualize the bridge's structure before diving into physical construction. Armed with a digital prototype, I proceeded to build a truss bridge using readily available materials: popsicle sticks and wood glue. Popsicle sticks were a logical choice due to their inherent strength, especially when stacked. Moreover, their simplicity facilitated the construction process. My ultimate goal was to engineer a bridge capable of supporting 50kg, and this demanded a creative approach.

The breakthrough in my design involved strategically stacking popsicle sticks to enhance the overall strength of the bridge. This innovative approach allowed for the creation of a robust and efficient load-bearing structure.

- Diagonal Links: I incorporated diagonal links into the design to reinforce the structure's stability.

- Chords: The chord configurations were carefully designed to distribute the load evenly and ensure structural integrity.

- Vertical Members: The vertical members of the truss had two distinct configurations, both meticulously planned to enhance the bridge's load-bearing capacity.

I methodically assembled these components, connecting diagonal links, vertical links, and chords to create the bridge's framework.

These elements were carefully orchestrated, culminating in the final bridge model, which met both span and width requirements, weighing a mere 397g.

The most remarkable aspect of this design was the strategic stacking of popsicle sticks, elevating the bridge's strength and surpassing the weight-to-load ratio goals.

Building the DIY bridge presented several challenges, notably the need for precision to ensure straightness. While the result was not perfectly straight due to some human error during assembly, I effectively mitigated this issue by using clips to maintain alignment after gluing.

Upon reflection, I identified areas for potential improvement. The main enhancement I would implement involves reinforcing the section that connects the two different truss sections, which could have prevented the bridge's failure and allowed it to carry its full capacity more reliably.

Additionally, I would reconsider the reinforcement in the upper and lower chords, transitioning from the current 3-4 configuration to a more efficient 2-3 configuration. This change would eliminate unnecessary cost and weight, making the bridge even more efficient.

In the end, the bridge's performance in load testing was impressive, comfortably sustaining a weight of 60kg, resulting in an outstanding weight-to-load ratio of approximately 151. This success demonstrated that the bridge design not only met but exceeded the project's objectives, showcasing the effectiveness of the innovative popsicle stick stacking technique.

Incorporating these proposed improvements, future iterations of the bridge could potentially achieve even higher levels of structural efficiency and load-bearing capacity.
