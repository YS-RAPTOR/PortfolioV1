lNOTE:::::::Go for more rigid animations than smooth and buttery feeling animations. Springy animation is ill advised

> Headings Entrance - staggered fade in from side with effect Glitch-Side/ Fade up with Glitch-Random
> Headings Hover - Shuffle

> For lists go with a terminal with terminal animation. (Basically only used to list skills)

> Icons(Assuming has link) use glow effect which looked cool. Neon Green Glow maybe

For Projects Card Windows Maximize Effect as Entrance with terminal animation for Text that is pretty fast (Maybe vertical cursor also) and glitch(random or side) for title
Minimize Effect when close to exit

Paragraphs - Random Glitch with Fade up might look good

Links - Make Color Transparent, Underline(Maybe) and outline the text

Header  - Not as happy
        - Maybe Experiment with the Header. More computery
